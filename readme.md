# uGrid

uGrid is an open source code engineering design and decision tool developed to aid the engineering,
procurement and construction (EPC) of sustainable, reliable minigrids. This toolset is built by the
minigrid developer, OnePower Africa, to meet their development needs including resource sizing and 
distribution network layout design. The toolset optimizing for a minimum cost of electricity, referred
to as the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The toolset is composed of two tools, uGrid and
uGridNet. uGrid performs resource sizing of solar, batteries, and propane generator based on
yearly load and weather profiles and a dispatch algorithm, all of which is customizable. uGridNet
performs distribution network layout design based on electricity connection locations, generation
station location, exclusion ("can't build here") zones, and a reliability cost benefit assessment. 

## Getting Started
Please read the "uGrid Documentation" word document in this folder for information on
how to get started with these tools, including necessary input data and expected output.

## Prerequisites
The user will need Python 3 installed and the python packages: numpy, pandas, math, pdf2image,
convert_from_path, PIL, time, networkx, shapely, openpyxl, geopandas and matplotlib.
